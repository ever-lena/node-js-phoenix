# The Definitive Guide to Accelerating Node.js Performance with Worker Threads

Node.js has revolutionized back-end development by providing developers with a single environment to build both front-end and back-end applications using JavaScript. This has been a real boon for teams at [Hybrid Web Agency](https://hybridwebagency.com/). However, its asynchronous, single-threaded architecture presents some limitations when it comes to processor-intensive workloads.

## Recognizing the Challenges of Node.js' Non-blocking Design

In conventional blocking I/O apps, asynchronous programming helps achieve parallelism by allowing servers to immediately respond to other requests rather than waiting on I/O operations. However, for CPU-bound tasks, asynchronicity yields fewer benefits.

To demonstrate this, consider calculating Fibonacci numbers - an computationally expensive problem. In a regular Node app, calling this synchronously would clog the entire event loop. No further requests could be processed until completion. 

We can showcase the issue with a simple code sample. We define a `fib` function and wrap it in `doFib` with Promises. Using `Promise.all()`, we concurrently invoke this 10 times:

```js
function fib(n) {
  // intensive calculation
}

function doFib(n) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    fib(n); 
    resolve();
  });
}

Promise.all([doFib(30), doFib(30)...])
  .then(() => {
   // handle results
  });
```

However, running this reveals the functions are not truly parallel - each stalls the event loop serially. The total runtime equals the sum of individual timings.

This highlights an inherent limitation: async alone cannot provide true parallelism. Even though Node.js is non-blocking, CPU-intensive work still blocks processing on single-threaded environments. The next section will show how worker threads solve this performance bottleneck.
